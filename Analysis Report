This report presents an analytical summary of Care UK’s annual data on anxiety and depression among patients. It consolidates key mental health metrics — such as depression scores, therapy sessions, stress levels, and substance use — into actionable insights. The purpose is to inform Care UK’s management and stakeholders on mental health trends and identify areas requiring intervention.

1. Introduction
Objective of the Project
To analyze and visualize patient data to uncover patterns in anxiety and depression across demographics such as age, gender, education, and employment. The insights will guide strategic mental health initiatives and improve patient care services.

Problem Being Addressed
The increasing prevalence of anxiety and depression across generations requires data-driven solutions. Understanding which age groups, employment statuses, and genders are most affected enables targeted therapy programs and resource allocation.

Key Datasets and Methodologies
Dataset Size: 1,200 patient records.
Data Fields: Age category, gender, depression score, sleep hours, education level, therapy count, stress level, and substance use.
Tools Used: Microsoft Excel for data cleaning, analysis, and dashboard visualization.
Methodology: Descriptive statistical analysis, visualization via bar and pie charts, and demographic segmentation.

2. Story of Data
Data Source
The data was sourced from Care UK’s annual mental health survey and patient therapy logs compiled from clinics across multiple regions.

Data Structure
Structured tabular dataset with categorical and numerical fields. Major columns include:

Demographics (Age, Gender, Employment Status, Education Level)
Psychological Metrics (Depression Score, Stress Count, Therapy Count)
Lifestyle Factors (Sleep Hours, Substance Use)
Important Features and Their Significance
Depression Score: Quantifies emotional well-being by age group.
Therapy Count: Indicates engagement in treatment by gender.
Stress Level: Captures education-related stress variation.
Sleep Hours & Substance Use: Reflects lifestyle influences on mental health.
Data Limitations or Biases
Unequal gender representation (more females in therapy).
Potential self-reporting bias in stress and substance data.
Limited sample of 1,200 may not generalize nationally.

3. Data Splitting and Preprocessing
Data Cleaning
Removed duplicate entries and standardized categorical labels (e.g., “Millennials,” “Gen Z”).

Handling Missing Values
Missing numerical fields were replaced with group medians to maintain data consistency.

Data Transformations
Normalized depression and stress scores for comparative visualization.

Data Splitting
Segregated by demographic variables (Gender, Age, Education, Employment) for targeted insights.

Industry Context
Care UK operates within the healthcare and wellness industry, focusing on preventative and therapeutic mental health services.

Stakeholders
Internal: Clinical psychologists, wellness program managers, HR, and data analytics teams.
External: Patients, mental health advocacy groups, public health partners.
Value to the Industry
Provides a benchmark for patient mental health trends and supports data-backed decisions in wellness program design and therapy service distribution.

4. Pre-Analysis
Identify Key Trends
Depression is highest among Gen X (3517) and lowest among Gen Z (2493).
PhD holders show the highest stress levels (1275), suggesting academic stress correlation.
Employed individuals have the highest substance use (320).
Potential Correlations
High stress levels correlate with higher education attainment.
Decreased sleep hours appear linked to younger generations (Gen Z).
Initial Insights
The younger demographic (Gen Z) shows lower depression but poorer sleep, indicating early-stage burnout risks.

5. In-Analysis
Unconfirmed Insights
Non-binary and “other” gender groups show distinct patterns but require larger sample sizes for confirmation.
Employment may exacerbate substance dependency due to work-related stress.
Recommendations
Implement stress management workshops targeting highly educated professionals.
Promote sleep hygiene programs for younger patients.
Analysis Techniques Used in Excel
Pivot tables for group aggregation.
Conditional formatting for stress/depression intensity.
Bar and pie charts for categorical comparison.
Line chart for family mental illness trend across genders.

6. Post-Analysis and Insights
Key Findings
Gender: Females recorded the highest therapy participation (569 sessions).
Age: Gen X exhibits the highest depression levels but also the longest sleep hours.
Education: Advanced degrees correlate with elevated stress counts
Employment: Employed individuals lead in substance use, followed closely by students.
Comparison with Initial Findings
Initial expectations suggested younger generations would report higher depression, but data indicates otherwise — Gen X leads, implying mid-life stress factors dominate.

7. Data Visualizations & Charts
Dashboard Overview
The dashboard consolidates all key mental health metrics into a unified visual platform.
Each chart contributes to identifying target populations for intervention.

Bar Chart: Depression Score by Age — Measures generational differences in depression.

Line Graph: Family History of Mental Illness — Tracks hereditary influence by gender.

Bar Chart: Sleep Hours by Age — Highlights lifestyle impact on rest quality.

Bar Chart: Stress Level by Education — Links academic attainment to stress.

Pie Chart: Therapy Count by Gender — Illustrates therapy access distribution.

Bar Chart: Substance Use by Employment — Evaluates behavioral coping mechanisms.

8. Recommendations and Observations
Optimizations or Business Decisions
Targeted Therapy: Focus resources on Gen X and highly educated individuals.
Workplace Programs: Address employee mental health through substance-use awareness campaigns.
Youth Support: Expand sleep management and resilience training for Gen Z.
Unexpected Outcomes
Higher depression among Gen X contradicts popular focus on Gen Z mental health crises.
PhD-level stress surpasses that of employed groups, suggesting academic support initiatives are needed.
9. Conclusion
Key Learnings
Data-driven approaches reveal hidden mental health patterns across demographics. The combination of high depression among Gen X, elevated stress in academics, and sleep deprivation among youth emphasizes the need for differentiated interventions.

Future Research
Further studies should expand datasets, include income levels, regional diversity, and long-term tracking of therapy outcomes to enhance predictive modeling of mental health trends.
